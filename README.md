The Code Manifesto
==================

This is an extension of the [Code Manifesto](http://codemanifesto.com/) that we follow at the [UCF Starters.](http://ucfstarters.org/)

We want to create an ecosystem that promotes collaboration and empowers starters to reach and exceed their potential. A safe haven for anyone to breathe life into their ideas. Often young entrepreneur lack direction and ask the question: Does my idea make sense? Is my idea right or wrong? We want to equip them with the tools with which they can give themselves permission to work on anything they want and answer those tough questions concretely. 

Creating such an environment requires a change in mindset and culture which benefits everyone that participates in it. When other developers and starters see a biosphere that appreciates and accepts as opposed to ridicule and bottleneck ideas, they want to join it too. 


In an effort to create such a place and the associated culture, we hold to the following values:

1. **Accept failure.** Entrepreneur often experience failure. Accept it, learn from it and move on. Positive, lasting change only comes from examination, discussion, and iteration.

2. **Discrimination limits us.** This includes discrimination on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, domain of study and any other arbitrary exclusion of a group of people.

3. **Boundaries honor us.** Your comfort levels are the same as everyoneâ€™s comfort levels. Remember that, and if brought to your attention, heed to it.

4. **Respect defines us.** Treat others in the same manner you wish to be treated. Make your discussions, criticisms and debates from a position of respect. Ask yourself: Is it necessary? Is it constructive? 

5. **Reactions require grace.** Angry responses are valid, but abusive language and vindictive actions are toxic. When something happens that offends you, handle it assertively, but be respectful. Escalate reasonably, and try to allow the offender an opportunity to explain themselves, and possibly correct the issue.

6. **Return favors.** None of us were born masters of our trade or anything for that matter. Each one of us has had some people to rely on for help along the way. Return that favor, when and where you can.

7. **Be a mentor.** Share what you know. Make yourself a resource to help those that come after you because you learn the most when you teach and it's also the fastest way to find your own short-comings. 

8. **Talk is cheap. Show me the prototype.** Once you have an idea, write it down, and try to come up with some tangible representation of it. This can be a mockup/wireframe on paper or better yet on the computer and doesn't need to be high quality. Just imagine it as a prop when you pitch your idea. 

9. **Start somewhere.** You don't have to build the next big multi-million dollar company, just follow your passions and see where they lead you, start small but start something. Don't spend all your time thinking about consequences of what might happen. That question kills ideas, do it and figure out what happens, you might be pleasantly surprised.

10. **Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.** Never stop thinking about your ideas and find every chance you can to get feedback on it. Pitch early and pitch often to anyone. There is a general co-relation between the simpler the idea, the more elegant it is and as a consequence of it, the more promising the product.
